@vmuth I've tested your readonly valamr solution a bit last weekend on OC 9.0.7 but am running into several problems, have you gotten any further with this yourself by any chance? ref: https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/24377

you can reach me at github@nowsales.nl

thank you in advance and have a great 2017!
Ronald
